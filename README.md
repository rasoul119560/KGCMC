## Introduction
In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular within recommender systems (RS) due to their capacity to capture essential features and interpret complex relationships. However, GNNs often struggle to fully represent fine-grained semantics within knowledge graphs (KGs) and may fall short in precisely modeling user-item interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach to personalized, knowledge-aware recommendation, termed KGCMC. This model combines a user-item interaction graph with a knowledge graph to enhance the representation of interactions, facilitating the generation of more informative and contextually aware node embeddings. A central feature of KGCMC is the incorporation of Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (GCMC), which effectively learns user and item embeddings by leveraging both user-item interaction data and the structural information in the graph. Additionally, an efficient attention-based sub-network is proposed to encode enriched semantic details from the knowledge graph into detailed item embeddings, tailored to individual users. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets using F1-score and recall metrics demonstrate the proposed methodâ€™s superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The results underscore the effectiveness of integrating GCMC within personalized, knowledge-driven recommendation models, showing it can successfully mitigate current limitations and improve recommendation precision and quality.
